In James 4:11-17, James addresses the issue of speaking ill of others and making plans without considering God's will. He admonishes believers not to speak evil of one another, for those who do so, judge their brothers and sisters and speak evil of the law. Instead, he urges them to follow the law of Christ, which is to love one another.

James also warns against boasting about one's own plans without acknowledging God's sovereignty and will. He emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and encourages believers to seek God's will in all their aspirations.

The Greek word used for "speak evil" in verse 11 is "katalaleite," which means to speak against or to slander. The word used for "boast" in verse 16 is "kauchaomai," which means to boast or to glory in.

James' message is particularly relevant for us today as we often engage in gossip and slander on social media and other platforms. We must guard our tongues and refrain from speaking ill of others, and instead, seek to build them up with our words. Additionally, we should seek God's will in all aspects of our lives, including our plans and aspirations.
