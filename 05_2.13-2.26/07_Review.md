# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. What do you think James means by "faith without works is dead"? How would you define faith and works in this context?
2. Why do you think James uses the example of Abraham? How does his story illustrate the connection between faith and works?
3. How do you reconcile James' argument that faith without works is dead with Paul's emphasis on salvation by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9)?
4. What are some practical ways we can demonstrate our faith through our works? How can we avoid falling into the trap of only talking about our faith without actually putting it into action?
5. How do you think this passage applies to our lives today? How can we use it to grow in our faith and relationship with God?
