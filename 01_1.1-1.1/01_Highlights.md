James 1:1 (NIV) says, "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings."

This verse introduces the author of the letter, James, who identifies himself as a servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. He is writing to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations, which likely refers to Jewish Christians who were living outside of Palestine.

Some scholars believe that this letter was written by the James who was the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Christian church. Others believe that it was written by a different James who was also a leader in the church.

The greeting in this verse is a common one in ancient letters, but it also has theological significance. James is affirming his belief in the divinity of Jesus by referring to him as "Lord."

The use of the term "servant" also carries theological weight. In Greek, the word used here is "doulos," which can also be translated as "slave." By identifying himself as a servant or slave of God and Jesus, James is emphasizing his submission to them and his desire to serve them.

Overall, this verse sets the stage for the letter and establishes James as a humble and faithful servant of God and Jesus who wants to encourage and instruct his fellow believers.
