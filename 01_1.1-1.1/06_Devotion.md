# Devotion

Dear friends,

Today, I want to focus on James 1:1, which reads, "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings." At first glance, this may seem like a simple greeting, but there is much more to unpack in this verse.

First, we see that James identifies himself as a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. This shows us that James understood his place in the world and recognized that his purpose was to serve God and follow Jesus. As we read further into the book of James, we see that he emphasizes the importance of faith and works, showing that true faith is demonstrated through our actions.

Additionally, James addresses his letter to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations. This reminds us that the early Christian church was made up of people from all walks of life, from many different nations and backgrounds. It is a reminder that the message of Jesus is for everyone, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, or social status.

So, what can we take away from this passage? One theme that stands out to me is the importance of serving God and following Jesus. As we go about our daily lives, it can be easy to get caught up in our own desires and priorities. But James reminds us that our purpose is to serve God and follow Jesus, which means putting our faith into action.

Another theme that stands out is the idea of unity in diversity. The early Christian church was made up of people from many different backgrounds, yet they were united in their faith. Today, we are called to embrace diversity and show love and respect to all people, regardless of our differences.

As we reflect on James 1:1, let us be reminded of our purpose as servants of God and followers of Jesus. Let us also remember to embrace diversity and show love to all people. May we put our faith into action and be a light in this world.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

Thank you for the message that we have received today from the book of James. We are grateful for the reminder that our purpose in life is to serve you and follow Jesus. Help us to live out our faith through our actions, and to be a light in this world.

We also thank you for the reminder that your message is for everyone, regardless of their background or ethnicity. Help us to embrace diversity and to show love and respect to all people.

Lord, we pray that you will give us the strength and wisdom to live out these truths in our daily lives. Help us to be examples of faith and love to those around us. And may we bring honor and glory to your name in all that we do.

In Jesus' name we pray,
Amen.
