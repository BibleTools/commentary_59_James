# Sermon

Dear brothers and sisters,

As we gather together today, let us turn our attention to the words of James in his letter to the community of believers. In the third chapter, James speaks to us about the power of the tongue and how we can use it to bring life or death, blessings or curses. But today, we will focus on verses 13-18, where James gives us a clear understanding of the kind of wisdom we should seek as followers of Christ.

First, let us understand the context of this passage. James, the brother of Jesus, wrote this letter to Jewish Christians who were facing various trials and temptations. These believers were experiencing conflicts, pressures, and challenges as they tried to live out their faith in a hostile environment. In chapter 3, James warns us about the dangers of uncontrolled speech and highlights the importance of using our words wisely.

Now let us focus on the main message of this passage. James contrasts two kinds of wisdom: earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom. Earthly wisdom is characterized by envy, selfish ambition, boasting, and lying. This kind of wisdom is rooted in the world's values, and it is proud, divisive, and destructive. On the other hand, heavenly wisdom is pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere. This kind of wisdom comes from God, and it is humble, unifying, and life-giving. James reminds us that the wisdom we choose to follow will determine the kind of life we live and the impact we have on others.

So, what is the message or lesson that we can take away from this passage? As followers of Christ, we are called to seek and embrace heavenly wisdom. We must learn to recognize the difference between earthly wisdom and heavenly wisdom and choose the latter. Heavenly wisdom is not something we can attain on our own; it comes from God, and we need to ask for it in prayer. It is only through the guidance of the Holy Spirit that we can develop a Christlike character that reflects the goodness, love, and wisdom of God.

But how can we make this sermon relevant and applicable to our lives? Let us consider some practical ways to apply the message of James to our daily lives. We can start by examining our thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors and ask ourselves if they reflect heavenly wisdom or earthly wisdom. We can also seek to grow in our understanding of God's wisdom by studying the Scriptures, listening to wise counsel, and surrounding ourselves with godly influences. Most importantly, we can pray for God's wisdom to guide us in all our decisions and interactions with others.

In conclusion, brothers and sisters, let us remember that the kind of wisdom we choose to follow will determine the kind of life we live and the impact we have on others. May we seek heavenly wisdom, which is pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere. And may we always remember that true wisdom comes from God, who gives generously to all who ask in faith.

Amen.
