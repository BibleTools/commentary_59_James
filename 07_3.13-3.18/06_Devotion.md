# Devotion

As we read James 3:13-18, we are reminded of the importance of wisdom, and how it can manifest in our lives. James asks, "Who is wise and understanding among you? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom." James is calling on us to be wise, but not just in theory or knowledge, but in how we live our lives. 

Wisdom is not just about what we know, but how we apply that knowledge. It is about the choices we make, the words we say, and the way we treat others. It is about living a life of integrity, and using our knowledge for good. 

But how do we attain this kind of wisdom? James tells us that it comes from God. He says, "But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." This wisdom is not something that we can earn or achieve on our own, but it is a gift from God. 

As we reflect on this passage, we must ask ourselves: How can we live a life that is wise in the eyes of God? It starts by seeking Him and asking for His wisdom. It continues by putting that wisdom into practice, by living a life that reflects our faith and values. 

Let us be mindful of the words we speak, the choices we make, and the way we treat others. Let us seek to be wise in the eyes of God, and to use our knowledge and understanding for His glory. May our lives be a reflection of His wisdom, and may we strive to live in humility, peace, and love. 

Let us pray:

Dear God,

As I come to You in prayer today, I am reminded of the powerful message found in James 3:13-18. This passage encourages us to seek wisdom from You, and to live out that wisdom in our words and actions.

Help me, Lord, to be a person of true wisdom. May I not be swayed by the world's definition of success or greatness, but instead strive to live a life that is pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.

I confess that at times, my tongue has gotten the better of me. I have spoken words that have hurt others, or that were not in line with Your will. Please forgive me, and help me to use my words to uplift and encourage others, rather than tearing them down.

I also ask for Your guidance in discerning between earthly wisdom and godly wisdom. May I always seek the wisdom that comes from above, which is pure, peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.

Thank You for the gift of Your Word, which provides such valuable guidance and insight. I pray that You would help me to apply the lessons found in James 3:13-18 to my own life, and to live in a way that is pleasing to You.

In Jesus' name, Amen.
