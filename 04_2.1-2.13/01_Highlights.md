Similarly, the word translated as "mercy" in verse 13 is "eleos," which refers to showing compassion or kindness to those in need.

The key words and phrases in this passage include "partiality," "faith," "works," "mercy," and "judgment." These words are important in understanding the author's message about the importance of treating everyone equally and displaying good works as a sign of true faith.

This passage relates to other biblical passages that emphasize the importance of treating others with love and respect, such as Matthew 22:39, which states, "Love your neighbor as yourself." It also relates to the theme of faith and works found in other biblical books, such as Ephesians 2:8-9 and James 1:22.

Overall, James 2:1-13 serves as a powerful reminder to Christians to treat all people equally and to back up their faith with good works.
