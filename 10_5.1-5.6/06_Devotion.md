# Devotion

As we read James 5:1-6, we see that James is addressing the wealthy and their treatment of the poor. He makes it clear that they have accumulated wealth through dishonest means and have mistreated those who work for them. James reminds them that their wealth will not save them and that they will face judgment for their actions. 

This passage may seem irrelevant to us if we are not wealthy or employers, but the truth is that we too can be guilty of mistreating those around us. We may not be withholding wages, but we can be unkind, selfish, or neglectful towards those we encounter in our daily lives. 

God's message to us through this passage is clear: He cares deeply about how we treat others. He desires for us to be honest, fair, and kind in all our dealings with one another. He also reminds us that our earthly possessions and status mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. 

As we reflect on this passage and its application to our lives, let us take stock of how we treat those around us. Are we being honest and fair in our dealings with others? Are we showing love and kindness to those who are less fortunate than us? Let us also remember that our ultimate treasure is not found in our earthly possessions but in our relationship with God. 

Let us pray:

Dear God,

As we come before you today, we acknowledge that everything we have comes from you. We recognize that all blessings and gifts are ultimately yours, and that we are called to be good stewards of the resources you have given us.

Yet we also know that there are times when we fall short. We are tempted by greed and materialism, and we may become too focused on our own wealth and possessions. We may even take advantage of others in order to gain more for ourselves.

So today we lift up James 5:1-6 to you, and we ask for your guidance and wisdom. Help us to remember that wealth and possessions are only temporary, and that true richness comes from our relationship with you. Help us to use our resources wisely and generously, and to be mindful of the needs of those around us.

We pray for all those who are oppressed or exploited by others, especially those who are vulnerable and without a voice. We ask that you would bring justice and healing to their lives, and that you would convict the hearts of those who perpetrate injustice.

And finally, we ask for your forgiveness for any ways in which we have fallen short in this area. Help us to repent and turn towards you, so that we may live lives that are pleasing to you.

We thank you for your abundant blessings, and we ask that you would continue to shape us into the people you have called us to be. We pray all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior.

Amen.
