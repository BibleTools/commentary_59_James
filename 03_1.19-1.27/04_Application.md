# Application

1. Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger (v. 19-20). This is a practical reminder to control our words and actions, especially in the heat of the moment. When we listen more than we talk, we can gain better understanding of others and avoid misunderstandings. When we are slow to anger, we can avoid harmful conflicts and preserve relationships.

2. Get rid of moral filth and evil (v. 21). This is a call to examine our own hearts and behaviors and get rid of anything that is harmful or sinful. This could involve confessing our sins to God and asking for forgiveness, seeking accountability from others, or making changes in our daily habits.

3. Humbly accept the word of God and put it into practice (v. 21, 25). This is a reminder that simply hearing or reading the Bible is not enough - we must put it into practice in our daily lives. This may involve making changes in the way we think, speak, or act, or seeking guidance and wisdom from God's word.

4. Don't just hear the word, do it (v. 22-25). This builds on the previous point - we must not only hear God's word, but also put it into action. This may involve taking practical steps to love and serve others, sharing the gospel with those who haven't heard it, or living a life that reflects God's character.

5. Care for those in need and keep yourself from being polluted by the world (v. 26-27). This involves both internal and external actions - we must be careful not to become tainted by the sinful values and practices of the world, and we must also actively seek to care for those who are in need, such as the poor, oppressed, or marginalized. This could involve volunteering, donating money or resources, or simply being a listening ear or supportive friend to those who are struggling.
