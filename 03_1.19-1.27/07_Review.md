# Review

We offer the following questions to aid in studying, reviewing, or facilitating group discussions.

1. How does James' instruction to "be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger" (v. 19) apply to our daily lives and interactions with others?
2. In verse 21, James urges his readers to "get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent." How can we practically apply this to our lives, and what might this look like on a day-to-day basis?
3. Verse 22 states, "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says." How can we avoid being deceived by simply hearing the word, and what does it mean to "do what it says"?
4. James goes on to talk about the importance of putting faith into action (vv. 23-27). How can we practically apply this, and what are some examples of ways we can live out our faith in our daily lives?
5. Finally, in verse 27, James writes that "religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." How can we practically apply this commandment to love and care for those in need, and what are some ways we can actively work to keep ourselves from being polluted by the world around us?
