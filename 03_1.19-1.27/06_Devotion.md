# Devotion

My dear friends, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.

Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at their face in a mirror and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do.

Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

In today's world, we are constantly bombarded with information, news, and opinions. Everyone has their own way of seeing things, and we can quickly become frustrated or angry when we do not agree with someone's view. James reminds us that we should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry. When we listen to others, we show them respect and value their opinions. We may not always agree with what they say, but we can still learn something from them.

James also tells us that we should get rid of all moral filth and evil and humbly accept the word planted in us. We should not just listen to the word of God, but we should do what it says. When we hear the word, we should be like a person who looks at their face in a mirror and remembers what they look like. We should not forget what we have heard, but we should do it.

Sometimes we may think that being religious is just about going to church or saying a prayer. But James reminds us that true religion is about looking after orphans and widows in their distress and keeping ourselves from being polluted by the world. We should not just talk about our faith, but we should live it out by showing love and kindness to those who are in need.

As we reflect on this passage, let's ask ourselves: Are we quick to listen and slow to speak? Do we humbly accept the word of God and do what it says? Are we living out our faith by showing love and kindness to those in need? Let's pray for God's help to live out our faith and be a light to those around us.

Let us pray:

Dear God, we come before you today humbly asking for your guidance and wisdom. We thank you for the reminder in James 1:19-27 to be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry. We ask that you help us to live out these qualities in our daily lives.

Lord, we also ask that you help us to rid ourselves of all moral filth and evil and to humbly accept your word planted in us. Help us not to just hear your word but to do it, to be a reflection of your love and light in this world.

We pray that you give us the strength and courage to live out our faith in practical ways, by looking after orphans and widows in their distress and keeping ourselves from being polluted by the world. May we be a living example of your love and grace to those around us.

Finally, we ask for your help to keep a tight rein on our tongues and to use our words to build others up, not tear them down. May our words be filled with kindness, compassion, and love.

Thank you, God, for your constant love and guidance in our lives. We pray all of this in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord, and Savior. Amen.
