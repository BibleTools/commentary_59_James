Dear brothers and sisters in Christ,

Today, we will be reflecting on James 4:1-10, a passage that challenges us to examine our hearts and motivations. Let us begin by understanding the context of this passage. James, the brother of Jesus, wrote this letter to Jewish Christian communities in the diaspora who faced persecution and were struggling with internal conflicts. In this particular passage, James is addressing the issue of conflicts and quarrels among believers.

The main message of this passage is that conflicts and quarrels arise from selfish desires, and that true wisdom is found in submitting to God and resisting the devil. James uses powerful language to describe the seriousness of these conflicts, calling them “wars” and “murders.” He emphasizes that these conflicts are not from God but from our own desires, which lead us to envy, covetousness, and greed.

The message that I want the congregation to take away from this passage is that true wisdom is found in submitting to God and resisting the devil. We must resist the temptation to pursue our own selfish desires, and instead seek to do God’s will. This requires humility, repentance, and a willingness to turn away from our sinful desires.

So how can we apply this message to our lives today? I encourage each of you to reflect on your own motivations and desires. Are there areas in your life where you are pursuing your own selfish desires at the expense of others? Are there conflicts or quarrels that need to be resolved in your relationships with others? Take time to confess your sins and seek God’s forgiveness and wisdom.

Additionally, we can resist the devil by drawing near to God through prayer, worship, and studying His Word. We can also resist the devil by standing firm in our faith and trusting in God’s promises. As we resist the devil, he will flee from us, and we can experience the peace and joy that come from submitting to God.

In conclusion, let us remember that conflicts and quarrels arise from our own selfish desires. True wisdom is found in submitting to God and resisting the devil. May we seek to do God’s will and resist the temptations of the devil, and may we experience the peace and joy that come from a life submitted to God. Amen.
