# Context

James 3:13-18 discusses two types of wisdom - worldly wisdom and wisdom from above. The passage teaches that the wisdom from above is pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. In contrast, worldly wisdom is characterized by envy, selfish ambition, boasting, and falsehood.

In the context of the early Christian church, this passage speaks to the struggles that Christians faced in discerning true wisdom amidst the various philosophical and religious beliefs of the time. Many people claimed to have wisdom, but not all of it was in line with Christian values. The passage also speaks to the challenge of living out a faith that values humility and selflessness, rather than the worldly values of ambition and self-promotion.

Furthermore, the instruction to seek wisdom from above would have been particularly relevant to early Christians who faced persecution and oppression from the Roman authorities. The wisdom from above, characterized by peace, gentleness, and mercy, would have been a helpful guide for navigating difficult and dangerous situations without compromising one's faith.

Overall, an understanding of the historical context of early Christianity helps us to see how James 3:13-18 addresses the struggles that early Christians faced in discerning true wisdom and living out their faith in a hostile world.
