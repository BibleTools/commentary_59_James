Dear friends,

Today, we are going to reflect on James 4:1-10. This passage highlights the danger of selfishness and pride in our lives, and how they can create a barrier between us and God.

James starts by asking a provocative question: "What causes fights and quarrels among you?" He then answers his own question by saying that these conflicts come from our own desires that battle within us. In other words, our selfishness is the root cause of our conflicts.

James goes on to say that when we ask God for things, we often don't receive them because we ask with wrong motives. We want things for our own pleasure and satisfaction, rather than for God's glory and the good of others.

The passage then turns to the issue of pride. James reminds us that God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble. He tells us to submit ourselves to God and resist the devil, and that if we draw near to God, He will draw near to us.

So, what message is God trying to communicate to us through this passage? I believe that God is calling us to examine our hearts and motives. Are we seeking God's glory and the good of others, or are we only focused on ourselves? Are we willing to humble ourselves before God and others, or are we consumed by pride?

As we reflect on these questions, let us remember that God's desire for us is to have a close and intimate relationship with Him. But we cannot do this if our hearts are filled with selfishness and pride.

Let us pray:

Dear Heavenly Father,

As I reflect on the words written in James 4:1-10, I am reminded of the constant struggles that we face in this world. We are prone to envy, greed, and selfish desires that often lead us away from you and the path you have set before us.

Lord, I ask that you help us to resist the temptation of our fleshly desires and turn our hearts towards you. Help us to find contentment in what we have, and to be grateful for the blessings that you have bestowed upon us.

As we humble ourselves before you, I pray that you would draw near to us, and fill us with your grace and mercy. May we resist the devil and his schemes, and choose to submit to your will and your ways.

Lord, I pray that you would renew our hearts and minds, and help us to live lives that are pleasing to you. May we be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry. And may our actions and words always be a reflection of your love and goodness.

In the name of Jesus, I pray these things. Amen.
