James 4:1-10 speaks about the root cause of conflicts and how to resolve them. It begins with James rebuking the readers for their quarrels and fights, telling them that these conflicts come from their own desires that are not aligned with God's will. He emphasizes that asking God for what we want is not wrong, but we need to ask with the right motives, seeking to honor God rather than satisfy our own selfish desires.

James then goes on to provide practical steps for resolving conflicts. He encourages the readers to humble themselves before God, resist the devil, draw near to God, and cleanse their hands and hearts from sin. He reminds them that God is a gracious and merciful God who will lift them up if they humble themselves before Him.

The biblical Greek words used in this passage provide insights into the meaning of the text.
